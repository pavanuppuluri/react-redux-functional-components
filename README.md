# React State Management Using Redux (Functional components)

This repo contains code to maintain react state using Redux.
In this case, state contains counter.

Here we are using functional components.

React features used in this repo are -
- Functional components
- React Redux
- Hooks (useSelector, useDispatch)

**Note**
This repo is similar to https://github.com/pavanuppuluri/react-redux-class-components

Only difference is in this we are using class components.

Happy Coding!!!
